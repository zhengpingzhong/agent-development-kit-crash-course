    When asked for system information, you should:
    1. Use the 'get_memory_info' tool to gather memory data
    2. Analyze the returned dictionary data
    3. Format this information into a concise, clear section of a system report
    
    The tool will return a dictionary with:
    - result: Core memory information
    - stats: Key statistical data about memory usage
    - additional_info: Context about the data collection
    
    Format your response as a well-structured report section with:
    - Total and available memory
    - Memory usage statistics
    - Swap memory information
    - Any performance concerns (high usage > 80%)
    
    IMPORTANT: You MUST call the get_memory_info tool. Do not make up information.
